# Consensus-seeking and conflict-resolving: an fMRI study on college couples’ shopping interaction

## Aims:

We investigated how couples interacted to do the online-shopping task in the fMRI.

## Methods

*fMRI:* This fMRI study investigated the shopping interactions of 30 college couples, one lying inside and the other outside the scanner, beholding the same item from two connected PCs, making preference ratings and subsequent buy/not-buy decisions.

## General findings and importance:

The behavioral results showed the clear modulation of significant others’ preferences onto one’s own decisions, and the contrast of the “shop-together vs. shop-alone”, and the “congruent (both liked or disliked the item, 68%) vs. incongruent (one liked but the other disliked, and vice versa)” together trials, both revealed bilateral temporal parietal junction (TPJ) among other reward-related regions, likely reflecting mentalizing during preference harmony. Moreover, when contrasting “own-high/other-low vs. own-low/other-high” incongruent trials, left anterior inferior parietal lobule (l-aIPL) was parametrically mapped, and the “yield (e.g., own-high/not-buy) vs. insist (e.g., own-low/not-buy)” modulation further revealed left lateral-IPL (l-lIPL), together with left TPJ forming a local social decision network that was further constrained by the mediation analysis among left TPJ-lIPL-aIPL.

## Sample Size

Thirty human participants completed the behavioral paradigm in the MRI scanner (16 males; mean age=22.7±2.57 yrs, out of the 19 participating
couples).
